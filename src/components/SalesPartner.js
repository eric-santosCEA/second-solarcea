            <p>
              Today, demand for solar in the United States is at an all-time
              high. The amount of solar power installed in the U.S. has
              increased more than 23 times over the past eight years -- from 1.2
              gigawatts (GW) in 2008 to an estimated 27.4 GW at the end of 2015.
              Thatâ€™s enough energy to power the equivalent of 5.4 million
              average American homes, according to the Solar Energy Industries
              Association. The U.S. is currently the third-largest solar market
              in the world and is positioned to become the second.
